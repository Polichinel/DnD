# A Place That Hungers

You wake to the sound of water weeping.

Salt lingers on your tongue, heavy and old, like grief that’s forgotten the name of what it mourns. The air is thick with rust and rot. Stone walls sweat cold, slick with green-veined moss and the scent of long-drowned things. Threads of salt crystal trail down from the ceiling like the residue of suffering that refuses to dry.

Chains hang from the walls—wet, rust-choked, and still moving, ever so slightly. Not from wind. Not from breath. Just memory, perhaps. The floor beneath you is uneven, soft in patches, and smells like the sea tried to crawl in and die. There is no light here, not truly—but through the cracks of the barred door, blue fire flickers faintly. Gaslamps. Somewhere beyond. It paints the chamber in a sickly glow, like a wound dreaming of healing.

At first, it’s just a sound.

A dragging. Wet and deliberate. Something heavy pulled across stone—limb by limb, like a corpse relearning how to crawl. It echoes through the corridor beyond your door, thick and uneven, the slap of meat against rock, slow but relentless. It doesn’t walk. It spreads.

Then comes the stink—like butchered fish left too long in vinegar and filth. A stench with intention, creeping through the bars before the thing itself ever arrives. Your skin prickles. Your breath shallows. The air is no longer empty.

You slam your palm against the bars. Once. Twice. The third strike rings out sharp and hollow.

Silence.

Then—impact.

The cell door shudders as something massive collides with it. A pause. Then a single arm slithers through the bars—pale and bloated, flesh sloughing from rust-colored bone. It wraps around your waist in a flash, tight, like a noose made of rot.

You twist into it, plant your foot against the wall, and wrench your body sideways. The arm snaps against the bars with a wet, splintering crack.

The creature screeches—a sound like wet metal dragging across bone—and tears the padlock from the door with impossible strength. The iron slams open.

And there it is.

A stitched monstrosity of meat and design, part alchemy, part cruelty. Glass vials protrude from its spine, half-sunken into ports like embedded keys. One flares—a thin line of greenish fluid drains into its ruined body. The shattered arm judders, bones twitching beneath skin like worms, reknitting themselves with obscene speed.

Then it lunges.

You dive back as claws rake the air where your throat was. It follows, half-stumbling, half-gliding, a feral stutter of hunger. The cell is too small. Too close.

You duck low, slip behind it as another blow slams into the stone wall—chunks fly. You faint left, twist right. The air hisses where its hand passes through it.

Then: opening.

A jab. Another. Both fists bury themselves in the thing’s collapsing face—if it has one. Cartilage splits. Fluids hiss.

You pivot.

Weight shifts. Leg coils.

Your heel crashes into the side of its skull with the sound of a fruit rotting mid-bite.

Its neck snaps. A burst of steam. Twitching silence.

The creature folds in on itself—shuddering, gasping, twitching—then finally collapses like a puppet with its strings cut wrong.

You exhale. Shaking.

Its body hisses faintly, even now. Something inside it still moving. Still trying.

You step over it, breathing hard, chain still slick around your forearm.

This was not born.
It was assembled.

And whatever made it...

Is still making more.

You crouch beside the twitching corpse, breath still coming ragged through clenched teeth.

The body steams softly—like it's trying to cool itself after something divine broke inside. Up close, it's worse. Stitched seams. Layers of flesh borrowed from different species. Some of the skin still bears tattoos. Others bear brands. One part—a shoulder—still trembles, as if not yet convinced it’s allowed to be dead.

But it’s the vials that hold your gaze.

Three of them. Embedded into sockets of corroded brass screwed into the creature’s back. One is half-empty, its fluid spent—whatever unnatural ichor was used to mend the broken arm now churning through its failed system. The others glow faintly, trapped in motionless suspension: one orange and viscous, another clear and swirling with veins of smoke, the last dark as blood left in the sun.

You hesitate. Then reach out.

The flesh resists at first—then gives, with a wet pop. The vial comes free, slick with slime. You stow it. Then another. And one more, twisting it from the iron socket as the corpse shudders its final protest.

They’re warm in your palm. Alive, almost.

You rise. Step over the wreckage. Out into the corridor.

It’s a corridor. But it feels like a throat.

Damp stone stretches ahead, lined on both sides by cells like empty sockets. Four to the left. Four to the right. Their bars sag with age and rust. Some still sway slightly—as if their occupants dream of movement.

Gas flames flicker above, set in sconces shaped like screaming mouths. The blue fire hisses, whispering in a language only fungus remembers.

The air here is thick with breathless memory—rebellion, rot, and waiting.

At the far end: a warped wooden door.

Something behind it pulses faintly. A heartbeat. Or a beckoning.

You glance back once—at the heap of muscle and ruin you left in your cell. Then forward, past the cells that watched you pass.

You walk on.
Because there is no other direction but forward.

The door moans as you push it open. Its warped wood drags across the stone like a tongue too tired to speak.

You step into a square chamber dense with the stink of alchemy and mildew, thick as breath in a sealed coffin. The air here is different—warmer, almost greedy. Shelves sag beneath the weight of flaking tomes, rusted tools, and jars that contain things that still move if you stare too long.

In the center stands a heavy stone table, its surface dark-stained and deeply scarred. A barred drain yawns beneath it like a wound that never closed.

There’s something beneath the table. A chest—half-hidden. Its lid cracked open like a jaw frozen mid-laugh.

But you don’t move for it.

Not yet.

You feel it before you see them.

One to your left. Another in the far right corner. Slouched. Still. Like discarded mannequins soaked in bile. Their skin is patchwork—stitched in grids and smeared with mold. Glass vials pulse on their backs, half-buried in brass sockets. One tilts its head slightly, its movement just wrong enough to scream.

They lunge.

No shriek. No warning. Just hunger.

You move—lower, faster. You drive your shoulder into the one on the left. It topples backward into a shelving unit. Bottles shatter. Green smoke spills.

The other swipes at your chest—too slow. You duck. Come up fast. Elbow under its jaw. Something inside it pops.

You spin. Elbow again. Palm strike. A knee to the gut.

The first is up again—dragging itself through broken glass. You catch it in the ribs with a sidekick. The thing bends, not from pain, but because the body remembers movement.

Then both fall.

Breathing hard, you glance around. No others. Just the quiet aftermath of sudden violence and wet meat.

You turn toward the chest.

Cautiously, you lift the lid.

Inside: your belongings.

Your boots, creased just where your foot does. A satchel marked with a glyph you don’t remember learning. Your dagger. Your hook and rope. Your things.

But how?

Who placed them here?
Who prepared for you?

No time to answer.

SKREEEEEEECH.

The far door whines on its hinge.
From the hallway beyond—six snarls, low and eager, echo through the stone.

They heard. And they’re coming.

You dive beneath the table.

Your fingers find the barred grate in the floor. You pull. It won’t budge.

You curse. Drive your shoulder into it. Again.

It snaps free with a wet metallic clatter.

A hiss behind you.

They see you.

One of them roars—a voice like glass and blood sliding down a drain.

You drop into the black.

The door barely breathes as you push it open.

You slip inside—silent, wary. The room beyond is square and low-ceilinged, thick with the musk of mold, burnt oils, and ancient ink. The air clings to your skin like a second, sick coat.

A wooden **work table** dominates the center. Upon it: schematics sketched in mad geometry, stained parchments, drawing utensils, half-melted candles, and books bloated from damp. One diagram shows a humanoid form opened like a flower. Another is a page of anatomical notes written in three overlapping languages—none of them yours.

You see them before they see you.

Two forms. One slouched beside the shelf on the left, the other pacing faintly at the far end. Their movements are *half-human, half-memory*—skin patchworked, joints too smooth. Each bears vials sunk into ports along the spine, brass-rimmed and humming faintly.

You don’t hesitate.

You *move*.

You slip across the stone—fast and low. Your first blow drives into the soft tissue just beneath the first creature’s arm. It grunts, stumbles. The other turns, too late.

You’re already on it.

An elbow to its temple. A spinning kick to the side of the jaw. It lashes out—claws rake your shoulder. You twist away, pain flaring, breath sharp.

The first recovers. Charges. You sidestep, grab it by the neck, and *slam* it into the table. Diagrams scatter. One claw finds your ribs—*rips*. You grunt, drop to one knee, drive an uppercut into its midsection.

They *fight*. But not well. Not like they remember how.

You finish it.

Palm strike. Rising knee. A low sweep knocks one to the ground. A boot crashes down onto its head. The other tries to crawl—glass vials glinting on its back like tumors. You crush one beneath your heel. Fluid hisses. The body *convulses*, then goes still.

Silence, again.

You breathe. Check the scratches. Not deep—but they burn. Like the claws carried rust or worse.

Your eyes find the **chest**, resting against the wall near the far door.

You open it.

Inside—your things.

Your boots. A satchel marked with a glyph your hand recognizes but your mind does not. Your rope. Your hook. Your dagger—still bent slightly at the tip.

They’re *yours*. Absolutely. Intimately.

But you don’t know how they got here. Or who made sure they’d be waiting.

You don’t have time to wonder.

*SKREEEEEEEK.*

The far door groans.

From beyond it—*six snarls*. Throats full of teeth and purpose.

They heard you. They’re coming.

You dive beneath the table. Your hands find the barred drain cover. You pull. It won’t budge.

You curse—*drive* your shoulder into it.

*CLANG.*  
It loosens.  
One more shove.  
It **snaps** free.

A shriek behind you.

They see you.  
They rush.

You drop into the dark.

You fall.

Not far—but far enough for the air to change.

Stone scrapes your shoulders. Moss smears your hands. The shaft closes around you like a throat unsure whether to swallow or speak.

Then—splash.

You land hard in knee-high water, thick and cold, black as dried blood. It sucks at your legs with a lazy pull, as if trying to remember how to drown.

You rise, dripping. Breath ragged. Skin burning where claws left their mark. The tunnel stretches ahead—low, damp, and narrow. A single stone ledge runs along its left side, barely wide enough for a footstep. The rest is flooded with ancient rot.

You move.

One step. Then another.

The water doesn’t flow. It sits. It waits. A broth of decay and forgotten purpose, threaded with mold that pulses faintly, like veins under translucent skin.

The walls are patchwork: stone, bonecrete, rusted piping, carved symbols worn into nonsense. Above, fungus droops from the ceiling in strands—some glowing weakly, others twitching slightly in your passing.

It smells like the past tried to preserve itself and failed.

Time does not pass here. It accumulates.

Something writhes beneath the water’s surface, just out of sight. You don’t look down.

You walk for minutes. Hours. The concept slips. This place is not measured by clocks—but by endurance.

Eventually, the tunnel begins to swell. The air thickens. The stone grows warm beneath your feet.

And something ahead… pulses.

The tunnel releases you into a round chamber, domed and echoing.

It breathes.

The walls glisten with damp and mucus—algae-slick and swollen with moisture. Thin runnels of black water feed in from half a dozen corridors like the one you just emerged from, trickling into a central cistern sunk into the stone. The water is still, heavy with grease and colorless mold.

Above the cistern, a single gaslamp burns blue behind a barred drain-lid in the ceiling. The light bleeds downward in a slow, exhausted column, casting faint shimmer over the surface of the stagnant pool.

And then—the walls begin to move.

Not moss. Not vine. The wetness itself begins to contract. Mucus. Slime. Algal threads thick with rot and chemical residue. It draws inward, climbing up the walls, spiraling together with a mindless sort of purpose.

The air tightens.

From six directions, the runoff continues. The room fills with the sound of dripping. Lapping. A slow, slurping anticipation.

Then the masses appear.

They coalesce from the wall-slime—three great, pulsing bulbs, not formed but suggested. Each trembles as it gathers shape. No skeleton. No center. Just skin over indecision, wrapped in hunger.

Then—they drop.

SPLAT.
SLAP.
THWACK.

They land in the cistern, sending brackish waves across the floor. A rancid mist rises.

Then they move.

No direction. No elegance. Just impulse. They drag themselves forward in heaving lurches, sprouting pseudopods and half-formed limbs that melt back into the whole. At times they try on faces—yours, perhaps. Faces that last only long enough to be recognized and forgotten.

The first surges toward you.

You leap aside. The water it leaves behind boils faintly on the stone.

You strike. Hard. Your fist sinks in like punching uncooked dough soaked in bile. You rip your arm back. A tendril swings low—you vault it, land hard.

You throw the hook.

It arcs, sings through the dark—and catches.

You climb.

One slime follows—wrapping the rope, climbing fast. Another slaps the wall behind you, beginning its own rise.

You draw your blade.

Slice.

The rope splits. The creature drops.
The others screech—high, mournful, eager.

They throw themselves at the wall. Begin ascending—not crawling, but oozing, spreading like blight up cracked stone.

You grunt. Your hands find the lid. You push.

It resists.

You scream through your teeth and shove again.

CLANK.

The lid opens.

You pull yourself through.

You collapse onto stone slick with mildew and salt.

Your chest heaves. Your hands are scraped raw. The gaslamp flickers behind the grated cell door, casting skeletal shadows across the floor. The air here is familiar—brine, iron, old sweat, rot. A perfect echo of the cell you woke in.

For a heartbeat, you wonder if you've crawled in a circle.

Then you see her.

Huddled in the far corner. Knees drawn to chest. Back turned. Forehead pressed to the wall like someone deep in prayer or long past despair. A tiefling. Barefoot. Shivering. Her shirt clings to her like wet paper, soaked with sweat—or worse.

She’s breathing.

Fast. Shallow. Like a bird caught in its own bones.

You hesitate.

Then cross the room.

The floor squelches beneath your steps. You kneel beside her. Gently, slowly, you reach out—fingertips brushing her shoulder.

“Hey,” you whisper. “Are you—”
